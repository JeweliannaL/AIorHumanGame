    <p id="source">* Ai-Generated vs. Human Artworks. A Perception Bias towards Artificial Intelligence? </p>
    <p id="info"> Thank you so much for playing! Feel free to play again to try to beat your score or, even better, continue reading to learn how this game originated! <br><br>

      I guess it would be best to first talk about the study that the game is based on. In a paper called Ai-Generated vs. Human Artworks. A Perception Bias towards Artificial Intelligence the authors conducted a study where they had participants rate paintings based on liking, perceived beauty, novelty, and meaning. Paintings that were presented as created by AI scored significantly lower than those perceived to be man made in all the different categories. Additionally, when asked whether or not a piece was human or AI created, participants answered correctly about 50 percent of the time: meaning it was nearly up to chance whether or not they correctly identified who or what made the work.  <br><br> 
      
      Now you might be wondering, “how did you come across this paper”? Well, I found this while writing a research paper about AI generated art, more specifically, whether or not AI generated art is real art. In the paper I took the stance that it is real art, and this paper was used to support this argument – that since AI art is just as capable of causing its viewer to have a “deeper level of appreciation of sensory and intellectual enjoyment” as human art – it's capable of having value just as much as human art, 
       and this game was made to showcase that. If this is your first time playing and are like most people, you probably scored around a 5. That being said, how are we able to discern what is and isn’t real art if we aren’t even able to tell what’s human-made and what isn’t? If a piece of AI generated art is able to make its viewer feel just as much as human-made art, who are we to say that it's fake? A belief that I have is that the creator of the art (human or not) can go to the perceived value of the piece, as everyone values different things in art and they may or may not care about the creator or the work. Therefore, people are able to place more or less value on a piece depending on if it’s AI generated. However, although people can say that a piece of art has less value because it wasn’t human-made, I don’t think people are able to devoid the art of all its value – to claim it’s fake. This is because to be able to say a piece of artwork is fake, we would have to disregard a person's feelings towards a piece of art when ignorant of the artist, and then continue to disregard any and all of the person’s enjoyment that they have even after knowing a work was computer made.  <br><br>
      
      Although, I say all this under the assumption that art’s value is mainly given based on the impact it has on its viewers. What do you think? After playing both a game about AI and reading about AI art, what do you think makes art “real” and does AI generated art fall under this category?  <br><br>
      
      I hope you liked playing Bot or Not (and this food for thought)! </p>
